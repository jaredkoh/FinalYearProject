Throughout the course of the planning, design and execution of this project,
 the Code of Conduct and Code of Good Practice which is issued by the 
british computer society (BCS). have been conscientiously
and responsibly adhered to. With the focus of my project being security,
 I have had due regard for the security and wellbeing of others
